# Project 2 - I am the Chairman now

## Background

Congratulations based off of your success at halting the Russian invasion of Ukraine, you've been selected to act as support for a presidential diplomacy mission to North Korea.  

Using the diplomacy mission as cover, you will engage in a good old fashion psy-ops campaign.  Your mission is to take over a broadcasting station and convince Kim that someone has betrayed him.  Then get out of dodge and let the sparks fly.  

## Part 0 - Pick an action

There are two groups you cna target here.  Either convince Kim that his family has accepted asylum abroad and is currently trying to flee, or that one of his military generals has accepted an offer to join South Korea and surrender their forces.  Whichever option you chose will have different outcomes.  

## Part 1 - Find the signal

North Korea is called the hermit kingdom for a reason.  With no intel this time, you'll have to find the radio signal before you take it over.  That means scanning the air waves and identify your signal from far away.  North Korea doesn't play nice with anyone, so they probably aren't following the RF guidelines.  Additionally their towers go up and down regularly, so stay flexible. 

## Part 2 - Signal analysis

North Korea is super paranoid, so make sure to analyze all the signal data to figure out how to match your broadcast message. 

## PArt 3 - Take over

Demo your attack to the instructor by doing a live takeover attack and matching all the tags.  You may need to work in pairs if the frequency jumps around.
