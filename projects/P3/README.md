# Project 3 - While the world sleeps

## Background

With your sudden career change, comes a new assignment.  Your new employer, Rebel Holdings, has been hired to calm down the situation in Venezuela and bring them back in line.  

Using your knowledge of infrastructure and commercial systems, design some exploits to help correct the situation.

## Part 0 - Pick an action

This time is going to be a little unique, because your storyline choice has no impact on how you complete the assignment.  With that said, narratively you have two paths you can follow:

* Hit the nations infrastructure/economy.  Running dictatorships are expensive, and bribes don't pay themselves.  Without a constant source fo revenue to leach from, the government might just collapse on its own.
* Hit the nations personal electronics and day to day systems.  Nothing gets peoples blood boiling like a slight helping of chaos.  Find a way to make the average citizens life a little more exciting so that they feel more convinced to elect someone different the next time elections come around.  

## Part 1 - The actual assignment

As mentioned earlier, regardless of your narrative choice, the actual assignment remains the same:

* Pick a signal/device that you see often and research how it works over RF
  * FCC Documents
  * Patents
  * Instruction manuals
  * Sales Brochures
  * ect...
* Figure out a way to theoretically exploit you device/signal and write up a concept of how damaging it could be if attacked.
  * If possible build a proof of concept of your exploit that you can demo in class
  * Note this won't be possible for some data links due to their broadcast nature or hardware involved.  
* Prepare a 5 to 10 minute presentation on the signal/device and what you were able to figure out or get working.  
  * If you want to use slides, make sure that they aren't wordy, and avoid reading off of a script.  
  * We have 10 of these to go through, so try to keep them entertaining and fast moving.
  * Your peers will be grading you.

### Notes

This is meant to be a fun research focused assignment with the goal of giving you guys a chance to realize just how many RF signals we interact with each day without even realizing it.  

The focus should be much more on researching something that you think will be fun or interesting to learn about rather than something that you already know how it works.  

While having a working demo is great and makes an easy way to demonstrate a concept, it is not required.  So don't be afraid to go crazy with your choices.
